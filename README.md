# Multi-module example

This project will tell you how to use clean architecture in a multi-module project.

In the project you can find the implementation of the following questions: 
- How to divide an application into modules? 
- How to organize the work of DI? 
- How to properly test a multi-module project? 
- How to work with gradle files?

I'll be glad to help. Telegram: @YuryH7
